# What's for dinner?

I was extremely bored and trying to break my habit of doom-scrolling, so I decided to create a "throw-away" app that will help me figure out what cuisine I want for dinner. Once I started creating it, I got swooped by a surge of motivation and decided to keep designing and developing more features. This is still a work in progress, but it has come farther than I ever thought it would :)
